# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Problem Statement

1. Build a machine learning model to identify fradulent credit card transactions.
2. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class inbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a classification algorithm,such as logistic regression or random forrsts to classify transactions as fraudelent or genune.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and f1-score and cosider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.
